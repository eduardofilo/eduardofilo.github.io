It\u2019s the perfect Spectrum (128KB, supports all models/ROMs from the various versions produced by Sinclair and Amstrad, and with components that can still be acquired today, including the ULA, which has been replaced by discrete logic). However, the option of purchasing a replica case of the original 48K (rubber keys) didn\u2019t really excite me.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, I came across Lee Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://leesmithsworkshop.co.uk/products/the-mechtrum-mechanical-keyboard-zx-spectrum-case\">ZX Mechtrum</a> project, a case for 48KB-format boards with a mechanical keyboard, and it seemed like the perfect complement for the Harlequin. In fact, in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr8KhQHaJr4\">video from the More Fun Making It channel</a>, through which I learned of its existence, its creator mentions that he plans to install a Harlequin 128 in one of these cases soon.</p>\n<p>Since there are already several videos and guides for both the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1klr5vRye0\">Harlequin kit</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FdXpOi2W4\">ZX Mechtrum</a> case, I won\u2019t detail the assembly process but will instead describe it generally and mention some peculiarities and problems I encountered.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2024-09-09T22:53:53.148293+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://apuntes.eduardofilo.es/en/2024-09-04_steam_deck_arch.html", "url": "https://apuntes.eduardofilo.es/en/2024-09-04_steam_deck_arch.html", "title": "Installing Arch Linux on Steam Deck", "content_html": "<p><img alt=\"Steam Deck with Arch Linux\" src=\"/images/posts/2024-09-04_steam_deck_arch/steam_deck_logo.png\"></p>\n<p>In July 2024, the 512GB LCD model of the Steam Deck was available for under \u20ac400 for a few weeks. This price was very appealing for a <a href=\"https://www.steamdeck.com/es/tech/deck\">decent machine</a> with an AMD processor based on x86 (AMD64) architecture, 16GB of RAM, an NVMe SSD of the mentioned capacity, a touchscreen, and integrated gaming controls. Essentially, it's a handheld PC, but still a PC. What makes this machine especially attractive to me is its full Linux support, making it an ideal platform for tinkering with Linux distributions or using it as a secondary portable PC. Of course, this is in addition to its conventional use for gaming and <a href=\"https://www.emudeck.com/\">emulating</a> video games.</p>\n<p>SteamOS, the default operating system, is based on Arch Linux, and in desktop mode, it can be used almost like a regular Arch Linux system. The main restriction is that it's built in immutable mode. While this type of system configuration has its virtues and it's understandable why Valve chose it for their machine, I still prefer a normal (mutable) system. So, I decided to install a regular Arch Linux and learn how to install this distribution. According to the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Steam_Deck\">Arch wiki</a>, the hardware of the Steam Deck LCD model is 100% supported by Arch.</p>\n<p>The following is the complete procedure I used.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2024-09-09T22:53:53.144762+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://apuntes.eduardofilo.es/en/2024-05-31_campus_aula_dei_en_bici.html", "url": "https://apuntes.eduardofilo.es/en/2024-05-31_campus_aula_dei_en_bici.html", "title": "Zaragoza - Campus routes by bike", "content_html": "<p><img alt=\"Cycling peloton\" src=\"/images/posts/2024-05-31_campus_aula_dei_en_bici/peloton.jpg\">\nPhoto by Javier Rodrigo</p>\n<p>Currently, I work at the Aula Dei Campus, about 15 km from Zaragoza. Although there are several options for getting to the campus by bus, in my particular case, the combination of routes and schedules is not favorable, so from the beginning, I chose to go by bike. After a few days of testing, I adjusted the route and equipment to make it more convenient and safe.
